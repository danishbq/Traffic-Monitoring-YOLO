# Traffic Monitoring: Vehicle Detection and Tracking

This project performs real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and classification on a video using YOLO11 for object detection and SORT (https://github.com/abewley/sort) for tracking. The system can detect and count vehicles like cars, trucks, motorbikes, and buses and display vehicle statistics at the end of the video.
